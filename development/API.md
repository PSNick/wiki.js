# Official API
Atropos has a Developer API Documentation section on the official `foundryvtt.com` website [here](https://foundryvtt.com/api/).

This is generated from the JSDoc comments within `foundry.js` that is accessible from every local installation of Foundry. It is advisable to open this file up and search it in your IDE, as all of the JSDoc comments are present and you can easily see what is really going on in the code.
