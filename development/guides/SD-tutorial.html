<p>Welcome to my system development tutorial for FoundryVTT! My goal is to guide you through system development with little to no knowledge of Foundry or the languages it uses. At first we'll walk through the steps to create relatively simple systems that allow you to collect data for things like stats and attributes and calculate modifiers for them, but eventually we'll get into more advanced topics like making dice rolls from your sheet or letting items be converted into macros.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, you can find me on the Foundry discord as @Asacolips#1867. And with that, let's move onto to the tutorial!</p>
