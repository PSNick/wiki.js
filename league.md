We are a collection of FoundryVTT package developers dedicated to helping make FoundryVTT a better place for GMs, Players, and Developers.

Some of the things we do:
- Moderate a more spread out discord environment for developers to ask and answer questions that has more elbow room than the primary foundry discord offers.
- Discuss package concepts and leverage a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/xYiqr7js/league-of-extraordinary-foundryvtt-developers) which aims to reduce duplicated effort.
- Support the adoption of [Abandoned/Endangered Packages](https://trello.com/b/FmfN4LHZ/endangered-packages).
- Collaborate with the Foundry Community to run the wiki.
