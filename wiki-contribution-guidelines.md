## Page Path

- Ensure your path is a url-friendly slug with no capitalizations.

## Compatibility Notice
```
> Page is known to be up to date with Core Version 8
{.is-info}
```
Include a notice at the top of a page which details when the page is last known to be accurate.

## Assets

When adding images to a wiki article, do so in a directory path that mirrors the path to the article itself.

E.g. for a page `/development/guides/foo`, the assets should be in a directory `/development/guides/foo/`.


## Editor Choice

- Always choose the Markdown Editor when creating a new page.


## Style Guide

- Since each page is topped with a main heading title, start with heading level 2 as the top level within an article. A page should not have more than 1 top level heading.
