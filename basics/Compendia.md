# Use 
Compendium Packs exist to reduce the strain on worlds that have been running for a long period of time. This includes situations where a world has accrued a large number of actors, items or scenes that, while not active, should not be deleted. Compendium Packs should be used to help you keep your world organized and reduce clutter.

Compendiums can be add in several ways. They may come with a game system directly, providing Items, Actors, or rules, such as in the DnD5e system and the SRD content.  Compendium packs are also used by modules to store large amounts of content to be unpacked and added to an existing game world, such as part of a premium or exclusive content pack.

**Note:** Any compendiums provided by a game system or module should not be used to store any user created/edited entities. When the system or module that provided the compendium is update, they will be overwritten, resulting in data loss of any user added entities. These compendiums are normally locked by default and should remain that way. 

Each Compendium can only contain one type of document: Actors, Items, Journal Entries, Macro Commands, Playlists, Rollable Tables or Scenes. Data contained in compendium packs are not loaded until needed, reducing the amount of data that a particular user must load when first joining a game.

**Entities in compendiums can now edited directly!**
This means you do not have to import an entity in order to make any changes.
