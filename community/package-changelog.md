From time to time, actions are taken to keep the official Foundry VTT package repository (displayed on the [website](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/) and inside Foundry) up to date.
Outdated or broken modules might get removed and modules that only work with past versions may get that hint added.
This page serves to keep track of such repository changes.
