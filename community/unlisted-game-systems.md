## Kryx RPG
* **Author**: shem / shemetz / itamarcu, shem#0226 on Discord
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: 0.6.5+
* **Translation Support**: EN

### Link(s) to Game System	
* [https://github.com/itamarcu/FoundryVTT-KryxRPG](https://github.com/itamarcu/FoundryVTT-KryxRPG)
* [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itamarcu/FoundryVTT-KryxRPG/master/system.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itamarcu/FoundryVTT-KryxRPG/master/system.json)

### Description	
An implementation of the [Kryx RPG](https://www.kryxrpg.com/) system. It's based on the D&D 5e system (with major changes). Playable, a bit untested, currently lacks compatibility with 5e modules (which is a planned feature) and lacks most content from the website (also a planned feature).

## Mage the Awakening 2e
* **Author**: SoulCake#7804 (Discord), happily accepting donations on [https://ko-fi.com/soulcake](https://ko-fi.com/soulcake) :)
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: 0.6.2+
* **Translation Support**: EN

### Link(s) to Game System	
* [https://gitlab.com/MarlQ/mta](https://gitlab.com/MarlQ/mta)	
* [https://gitlab.com/MarlQ/mta/-/raw/master/system.json](https://gitlab.com/MarlQ/mta/-/raw/master/system.json)	

### Description	
For now purely a system for Mage the Awakening 2e, supporting Mages, Sleepwalkers, and normal Mortals. People can think of this as an alternative for the Chronicles of Darkness system by Burzghash, though some of my code has already found its way into Burzghash's system. It will be developed for at least another year, though development might continue afterwards if people are interested. The system is currently stable, and supports all necessary features to get started. The character sheet design is vastly different from the original with many QoL features.

# Unreleased Game Systems

This list is a holdover from the previous Wiki's information and may be outdated. These systems had no project links at the time of cleanup and so their status couldn't be ascertained.

## Tales from the Loop / Things from the Flood
* **Author**: onf#2586
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: 0.6.0+
* **Translation Support**: English / Fran√ßais
### Link(s) to Game System	
* Not available yet
### Description	
In Tales from the Loop, you are playing a kid in an alternative 80s uchrony inspired by the world painted by [Simon Stalenhag](https://www.simonstalenhag.se/). Giant robots are eerily roaming enormous particle accelerators which are driving the world's technological leap, while also being the epicenter of strange mysteries. TFTL is about the ordinary meeting the extraordinary with a sci-fi twist. Government conspiracies, unknown technologies and chilling mysteries coexist with school dramas. 

Things from the Flood expands the timeline of the game into the 90s where player characters grew up to become teens. This extension has a way darker tone, with governments selling their secrets to corporations and technology becoming even more unpredictable and scary.

Being a content light system, making this system is mostly about making it's sheet and some logic for integrated rolls. I don't know yet if TFTL and TFTF will coexist in the same game system or if they are going to be two separate things.

# Appendix	

## Appendix A: Adding a Game System	

**Copy and paste the outline below in writing up new game system descriptions, formatting and all!**	
```	
## (Game System Name)	
* **Author**: (Put author‚Äôs name here, including Discord username. If they accept contributions in code or donations, note this here as well.)	
* **Version**: (Note current version of game system here.)	
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: (Note which versions of Foundry Virtual Tabletop the game system is compatible with.)	
* **Translation Support**: (Note which languages are supported, and if they have (full) or (partial) translations.	
### Link(s) to Game System	
* (Put a web URL here to find the game system.)	
* (Put the manifest url here to update/install the game system.)	
### Description	
(Describe the game system here. This should include the game system‚Äôs function, installation instructions, and anything important to note. Due to the particular oddities of some archiving programs (WinRar, 7zip), and GitHub zip folders, including a screenshot of what the module should look like file-wise in the ‚Äúpublic/systems/examplesystem‚Äù is appreciated, though not required.)	
---	
```	

## Appendix B: Best Editing Practices	

- Links to game systems should link to the author‚Äôs page for it, if such exists. This helps emphasize the game system author‚Äôs control over their creation, and allows users to see information that the game system author deems important. If you have the game system author‚Äôs permission otherwise, or you are the creator, feel free to link directly to the game system download link. 	
- Game Systems are sorted by system compatibility, then function, and then alphabetically.	
- Ensure that Foundry is noted as ‚ÄúFoundry VTT‚Äù or ‚ÄúFoundry Virtual Tabletop‚Äù in writing, unless it is the system title, or the module author desires otherwise in the description. This helps emphasize Foundry‚Äôs role as a unique, standalone tabletop, and helps distinguish it from other brands using the word ‚Äúfoundry‚Äù.   	
- Ideally, each game system should be separated by a single line break. This is just to help it look neat. 	
- Game Systems should not be listed if they violate existing copyright law.
