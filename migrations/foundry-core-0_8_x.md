## ActorSheet#getData

> Most Likely Affects: Systems
{.is-info}

Relevant Issue: [Redesign the structure of ActorSheet#getData to provide more sensible references for the actor, its data, and any items or effects that the actor owns.
](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/4321)

ActorSheet's default `getData` method's return signature changed. If your system did not override this to create your own data for the template, your template might need adjusting.

**It is highly recommended by Foundry to create your own return data object that is returned from this method**

### What changed between 0.7 and 0.8?

In 0.7 `ActorSheet#getData()#actor` was a copy of `Actor#data`. In 0.8 it is a copy of the Actor document itself. This means the path to the value being changed is no longer the same as the path to the value being displayed.

Practically this is what might need to be changed in your handlebars templates:

#### :x: 0.7
```html
<input name="data.foo" value="{{data.foo}}" />
```

#### :heavy_check_mark: 0.8
```html
<input name="data.foo" value="{{data.data.foo}}" />
```

### âœ… 0.8 recommended
```js
getData(options) {
  let baseData = super.getData(options);
  let sheetData = {};
  sheetData.foo = baseData.actor.data.title;
  return sheetData;
}
```
```html
<input name="data.foo" value="{{foo}}" />
```

## Hooks

> Most Likely Affects: Systems, Modules
{.is-info}

### [New Hooks Documentation](https://foundryvtt.com/api/alpha/hookEvents.html)

As part of the transition to Documents as the primary base for all data structures in Foundry Core, the hooks related to ~~Entities~~ Documents have been standardized.

All Embedded Documents use the same hooks as their top-level counterparts:

- preCreate[documentName]
- create[documentName]
- preUpdate[documentName]
- update[documentName]
- preDelete[documentName]
- delete[documentName]

There are more detailed docs about what each Hook does and what arguments it has available in the official [hookEvents documentation](https://foundryvtt.com/api/alpha/hookEvents.html).

### Note for System Developers

It is not recommended for Systems to leverage these hooks. Each of these hooks is fired by a corresponding method on the base Document type which you can overwrite for a more safe and consistent way to accomplish this logic.

```js
class MySystemActor extends Actor {
  async _preCreate(data, options, user) {
    // do stuff to data, options, etc
  	await super.preCreate(data, options, user);
  }
}
```

### What changed between 0.7 and 0.8?

All hooks related to embedded entities were removed. These embedded entities are treated as Documents same as their Parents are in 0.8. As a result all of the hooks around EmbeddedDocuments and top level Documents could be standardized.
