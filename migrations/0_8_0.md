![documents.png](/documents.png)

## 0.8.0

https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Breaking&milestone_title=Alpha+0.8.0+-+Next-Gen+Infrastructure&scope=all&state=closed


> Allow for merging Application options when calling Application#render(force, options) to conveniently assign or toggle application options when the interface is re-rendered.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/allow-for-merging-application-options)


> Collection#get should return undefined on a failed lookup, rather than null, to remain compliant with the parent Map behavior.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/collection-get-undefined)


> Convert all server-side primary and embedded document models to use the new shared AbstractBaseData and AbstractBaseDocument interfaces.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/abstract-base-data-document)


> Create a Combatant embedded entity type which internalizes helper methods for manipulating a combatant entry within the Combat tracker.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/combatant-entity-type)


> Create a formalized PlaylistSound embedded document type, instances of which belong to the playlist#sounds Collection.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/playlist-sound-document)


> Document pre-create hook events are now provided with the candidate Document instance instead of merely the raw data object provided for the creation.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/document-pre-create-instance)


> EmbeddedEntity create, update, and delete hooks are now passed the EmbeddedEntity document instance instead of only the raw object data involved in the operation.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/embedded-entity-crud)


> Formally deprecate the SceneData.description attribute which has been unused since an early Beta version when Scene's could be linked to Journal Entries.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/scenedata-description)


> Improve TokenConfig.getTrackedAttributes to differentiate between "base" attributes which can be edited and "derived" attributes which are deterministic. Prevent the editing derived tracked attributes through the Token HUD.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/token-get-tracked-data)


> Migrate to Node.js 14.x which is now REQUIRED in order to utilize server-side ESModules and V8s.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/node-14-required)


> Move Actor owned item management methods (getOwnedItem, createOwnedItem, updateOwnedItem, deleteOwnedItem) to the deprecation path in favor of manipulating OwnedItem instances directly.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/owned-item-management)


> Move calls to Document#prepareData outside of Document#_onUpdate to avoid cases where a system developer overrides this event handler and forgets to re-prepare Document data.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/prepare-data-not-on-update)


> Redesign the structure of ActorSheet#getData to provide more sensible references for the actor, its data, and any items or effects that the actor owns.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/actorsheet-getdata-references)


> Refactor the Setting class to follow the standard interfaces used by other Document types
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/refactor-settings)


> Rename Collection#entries to Collection#contents to avoid colliding/overriding the default Map#entries behavior with a differently behaved property
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/collection-entries)


> Rename PlayerConfig to UserConfig for increased consistency with how other configuration applications are named relative to the base Document type that they modify
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/rename-player-config)


> Rename sidebarCollapse to collapseSidebar
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/collapseSidebar)


> Rename the socketListeners static method of several classes to _activateSocketListeners to more semantically describe the action that is taken as well as to denote that the method should not be called by external code.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/refactor-socket-listeners)


> Safari â€“ Issue with static class fields
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/safari-compatibility)


> Separate functions and UI that are used exclusively outside the /game endpoint into a separate JS file which does not unnecessarily expose those to regular users.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/separate-extra-game-functions)


> Serializing a DocumentData instance will now only return the _source component of that data which needs to be persisted in the database rather than the full data object including derived data elements or downstream transformations
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/serializing-document-data)


> Split the responsibility of the current PlaceableObject class into core data management, permission control, and configuration which extends EmbeddedEntity vs the Canvas object representation and UX which extends PlaceableObject
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/placeable-object-refactor)


> Standardize the representation of the canvas global to have the same expected properties in cases where a canvas is used as well as in cases where no canvas is present.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/canvas-global)


> The base Entity class has been deprecated in favor of a DocumentMixin combined with AbstractBaseDocument class definitions.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/no-base-entity)

> Tidy up SidebarDirectory class
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_0/sidebar-directory-documents)




## 0.8.1

> Delete the legacy and unused jquery "shake" extension from the codebase
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/remove_shake)


> Improve the way that DiceTerm modifiers are evaluated to record the exact set of modifiers which were applied, eliminating any invalid matches from the final formula.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/improve-diceterm-eval)


> Change the default behavior for what is automatically populated as ChatMessageData#content when a Roll is included in a Chat Message.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/change-default-roll-chat-message)


> RollTable#roll refactored to async to now return a Promise in support of asynchronous dice rolling infrastructure.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/async-rolltables)


> Reorganize the helper methods used to compute sound and vision source polygons into the WallsLayer as a generalized computePolygon helper which both the sight and sounds layer use (with different arguments).
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/reorganize-wall-layer-helpers)


> Replace localizations which previously encoded HTML "Are You Sure" messages as two separate localization strings.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/replace-localizations)


> Collection#find should have the same return type as Array#find
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/collection-find)

> Miscellaneous compatibility issues related to breaking changes in 0.8.0
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/misc-compat-issues)


> Some moved utility functions which cause breaking changes were not documented in the 0.8.0 change-notes.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/sidebar-directory-documents)


> Establish universal standard for hook signatures which work symmetrically for all types of Document definitions.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/sidebar-directory-documents)


> Refactor DiceTerm.getResultLabel to be an instance method DiceTerm#getResultLabel allowing for more nuanced formatting of the labeled output.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/sidebar-directory-documents)


> Add an asynchronous version of the dice and rolling APIs
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/sidebar-directory-documents)


> Redesign the game.audio.play utility method to resolve issues with incorrect howler syntax and to migrate to the new Web Audio SoundNode implementation.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/sidebar-directory-documents)


> Deprecate use of the Howler.js library (immediately) in favor of a move to using native and more modern Web Audio APIs.
> [Wiki Page](/en/migrations/0_8_1/sidebar-directory-documents)
